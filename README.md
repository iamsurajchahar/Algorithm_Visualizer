# Algorithm Visualizer ðŸ“Š

## About

This Algorithm Visualizer ðŸ“Š visualizes every algorithm, including sorting, searching, trees, and graphs. It helps you understand them more easily and provides a thorough understanding ðŸ§ . This way, you won't have any difficulty implementing them while learning data structures and algorithms ðŸš€.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Visualize and understand various sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.

- **Searching Algorithms**: Explore and grasp the working of popular searching algorithms like Linear Search, Binary Search, and others.

- **Tree Algorithms**: Gain insights into tree data structures and algorithms like Tree Traversals, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, and more.

- **Graph Algorithms**: Understand graph algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm, and others.

- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Follow the execution of algorithms step-by-step, with visual representations and animations to enhance your understanding.

- **Customizable Input**: Provide your own input data to observe how the algorithms handle different scenarios.

- **Algorithm Comparison**: Compare the performance and behavior of different algorithms side-by-side for the same input.
